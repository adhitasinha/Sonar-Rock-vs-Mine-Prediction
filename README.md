# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction 

**Project Summary**
A Python-based, end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on sonar signal data. This implementation follows Siddhardhan’s video walkthrough, which demonstrates loading data in Google Colab, feature handling, training a Logistic Regression model, and evaluating performance ([YouTube][1]).

---

##  Repository Contents

* `sonar_dataset.csv`: UCI Sonar dataset — 208–209 samples, 60+ features + label.
* `Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook showcasing the full workflow.
* `README.md`: This documentation.

---

##  Workflow Overview

1. **Environment Setup**
   Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**

   * Load dataset using `pandas.read_csv`.
   * Separate features (`X`) and labels (`y`; “R” for rock, “M” for mine).
   * (Optional) Scale features using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Train-Test Split**

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
       X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
   )
   ```

4. **Model Training**

   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   model = LogisticRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

5. **Evaluation**

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, model.predict(X_train))
   test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))
   print(f"Train Acc: {train_acc:.2%}, Test Acc: {test_acc:.2%}")
   ```

   Expect \~83% training accuracy and \~76% test accuracy ([GitHub][2], [GitHub][3]).

6. **Prediction on New Data**
   Use `model.predict(new_data)` to classify fresh sonar measurements, with preprocessing consistent with training.

## ✅ Installation & Usage

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.git
cd SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
```

Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.ipynb
```

or open it directly in **Google Colab**.

##  Next Steps & Enhancements

* Experiment with alternative classifiers: KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks ([GitHub][4], [GitHub][2]).
* Tune hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength) using `GridSearchCV`.
* Apply feature scaling techniques and visualize feature importance.
* Implement confusion matrix, precision/recall, and ROC curve evaluations.
* Create a lightweight API (e.g. using Flask or FastAPI) to serve model predictions.
